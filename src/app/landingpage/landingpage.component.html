            Lawyers spend about 10 hours per case on manual 
            research to build persuasive arguments for court 
            which is both time consuming and prone to human error 
            leading to potential setbacks in legal proceedings.

            We are an online platform for predictive legal analysis. 
            We help lawyers check where and how many times their argument 
            succeeded in previous cases to help them save time and make 
            better informed decisions.
